### 🚀 What I do

- Build **end-to-end ML services**: data preprocessing → modeling → API → deployment.
- Work with **text & NLP**: address extraction, RAG pipelines, multilingual question answering.
- Explore **geospatial & agro data**: fields, fertilization maps, spatial joins and feature engineering.
- Participate in **hackathons & competitions**, where deadlines are short and models must actually work.

### ⭐ Highlighted projects

#### 🔎 RAGFlow – Retrieval-Augmented QA Service  
> `NLP · RAG · Elasticsearch · Transformers · FastAPI`  
Repo: [RAGFlow](https://github.com/Lin-Lini/RAGFlow)

A modular RAG pipeline that:
- ingests PDFs/DOCs/PPTX files and splits them into semantic chunks;
- indexes content with **SBERT embeddings** in **Elasticsearch**;
- answers user questions using **Vicuna / FLAN-T5** with source highlighting;
- supports multilingual flows via **MarianMT** (ru ↔ en).

This is my base platform for experimenting with LLM-based information retrieval.

#### 🌿 plant-health – Tree & Plant Health Analysis  
> `Computer Vision · Segmentation · Classification · Geo/Agro domain`  
Repo: [plant-health](https://github.com/Lin-Lini/plant-health)

End-to-end pipeline for plant/tree health monitoring:
- segmentation of plants and defects on images;
- health/condition classification and basic analytics;
- integration with geospatial context for agronomic scenarios.

This project reflects my interest in combining **CV + agriculture + geodata** into something practically useful.

#### 🧑‍🏫 assistant-teacher – Agent System for Educators  
> `LLM Agents · RAG · Kafka · MinIO · Elasticsearch · FastAPI`  
Repo: [assistant-teacher](https://github.com/Lin-Lini/assistant-teacher)

Backend of an **agent-style assistant for teachers and students**:
- parses and indexes course PDFs into Elasticsearch using a vectorizer service;
- answers questions with RAG over course materials;
- generates quizzes asynchronously via Kafka + LLM and stores them in MinIO;
- automatically grades quiz answers and returns detailed feedback.

Designed as a multi-service system with specialized workers (parser, generator, grader) coordinated by an LLM “router”.

#### 👥 All-Russian-hackathon – User Demographics Prediction  
> `Tabular ML · Behavioral Data · Competition`  
Repo: [All-Russian-hackathon](https://github.com/Lin-Lini/All-Russian-hackathon)

Competition project focused on:
- predicting socio-demographic attributes of users from behavioral/interaction logs;
- feature engineering from noisy event data;
- model comparison (classic ML methods, regularization, ensembles).

Shows my experience with **realistic, messy data** under hard competition constraints.
